## Overview
Le Petit Prince (LPP) Multitalker Dataset us a high-quality, naturalistic neuroimaging dataset featuring a total of 40 minutes of electroencephalogram (EEG) and 7T functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) recordings from 26 native Mandarin Chinese speakers as they listened to both single-talker and multi-talker speech streams. Validation analyses conducted on both EEG and fMRI data demonstrate the datasetâ€™s high quality and robustness. Additionally, the dataset includes detailed transcriptions and prosodic and linguistic annotations of the speech stimuli, enabling fine-grained analyses of neural responses to specific linguistic and acoustic features. The LPP Multitalker Dataset is well-suited for addressing a wide range of research questions in cognitive neuroscience, including selective attention, auditory stream segregation, and working memory processes in naturalistic listening contexts.
